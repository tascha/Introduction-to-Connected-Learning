## Why ConnectedLib? {#why-connectedlib}

_ConnectedLib_ was created to equip public youth librarians with the knowledge and skills they need to create connected learning programs at their own libraries. The modules can be taken as standalone courses in any order, but the program as a whole is designed to walk you through the connected learning basics, help you learn how to work effectively with teens, how to strategize and plan to implement connected learning, and how to reach out and work with your community to bring teens resources and relationships they canâ€™t find anywhere else.
