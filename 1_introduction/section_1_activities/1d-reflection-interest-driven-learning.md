### 1D. Reflection: Interest-Driven Learning

Reflect on what Constance Steinkuehler said about interest-driven learning. Think back to a time in your youth when an adult tried to get you to learn something you weren’t interested in. Then think of a time you were very interested in learning about something. How did those experiences differ? Share your experience with the group. Here are a few questions to get you started:
* How much time did you spend learning about the topics? 
* Do you still remember anything about the topics? 
* How engaged were you with the topics—did you ask questions or do your own research? 
* How did the adult (if any) in the situation interact with you?
