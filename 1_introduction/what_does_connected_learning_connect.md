## What does connected learning connect? {#what-does-connected-learning-connect}

Teens’ learning occurs primarily in three different contexts, or spheres: their relationships, their unique personal interests, and their academic, work, or community settings.[^2] When the spheres are connected, teens’ quality of learning and engagement with learning increases.

<table class="table-format"><tr><th bgcolor="#fe9a85">Interests</th><td>Aligned with teens’ goals and motivations</td></tr>
<tr><th bgcolor="#96fe85">Relationships</th><td>Teens learning with and from other teens as well as adults</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="C9DAF8">Opportunity</th><td>Directed towards academic, civic, or economic achievement</td></tr></table>

Learning that engages all of these spheres is no longer learning teens _have_ to do; it’s learning teens _want_ to do because it is aligned with their goals and benefits these important areas of their lives.

### Interests {#interests}

>“So it&#039;s about getting teens… learning through their interest, through whatever they&#039;re personally interested in… Maybe they love music, so you get them learning maybe a new software music editing program because they love music so much and they want to create it. So really taking those detailed individual interests and saying, ‘Oh, you really enjoy that? Well, here&#039;s something that you can use to be able to create and do it on your own.’”<br/>— Suburban Northeast Library

Learning that driven by teens’ interests will better align with their personal motivations and goals, leading to deeper learning and higher achievement, which can help relatively disadvantaged youth overcome the obstacles and difficulties present in a more traditional educational setting.The teen years are a time for identity formation, and connected learning can help teens discover and explore new interests.

<p>Constance Steinkuehler describes her first-hand experience with the power of interest-driven learning.</p></div>


>“Teens don&#039;t often know what their passions are. We need to help them explore possibilities for their passions and give them the tools necessary to explore those passions.”<br/>-- Urban Midwest Library

#### What does interest driven learning look like? {#what-does-interest-driven-learning-look-like}

*   Library staff get to know teens and what they’re interested in, both their “serious” interests (like filmmaking, creative writing, or a health condition) and their “fun” interests (like specific TV shows or books)
*   Teens can explore and form new interests with “messing around” activities that provide light introductions to topics
*   Teens feel free to “quit” new subjects that they find uninteresting
*   For those who want more than just “messing around,” there are also “geeking out” opportunities
*   “Pathways for mastery” guide teens in developing their interests and recognizing their achievements

### Relationships {#relationships}

>“Watching the teens find each other and connect with each other and realize,’Oh, I&#039;m not the only geek on the planet, and there are other people that are really into stuff in an intense way and that&#039;s okay and we can celebrate it’...Our writing club did fairytale fanfiction all summer and it was awesome to see how they bonded and got more comfortable sharing their geek with each other... Connecting the teens to each other is [a] huge success.”<br/>-- Suburban Northeast Library  

When learning is supported by relationships, teens aren’t just learning _with_ each other—they’re also learning _from_ each other by sharing their ideas, providing constructive feedback, and collaborating on projects.

#### What does learning through relationships look like? {#what-does-learning-through-relationships-look-like}

*   Teens have time and space to “just hang out”
*   Teens collaborate, share projects and activities, and give constructive feedback to each other
*   Programs incorporate elements of culture that are important to teens
*   Staff help teens build or join a community around their interests

### Opportunity {#opportunity}

>“A college degree has become a requirement for most good jobs but is no longer a guarantee of acquiring one.”<br/>-- Mimi Ito[^2]

Opportunity-oriented learning is directed towards helping teens achieve academic, economic, or civic success, so they perform better in school, build skills that prepare them for a 21st century workplace, or connect with their communities. More importantly, connected learning emphasizes opportunity _now_, not just in the far-off, theoretical future of a post-school college or job market. Connected learning programs make the benefits to teens visible and tangible, motivating them to fully engage. Participants walk away with knowledge and skills they can use immediately.

<p>Geoff Mulgan describes how the UK’s studio school model has taken teens from the lowest to the highest grades by letting them “learn for real.”</p></div>

#### What does opportunity-oriented learning look like? {#what-does-opportunity-oriented-learning-look-like}

*   Teens are connected to mentors with professional experience
*   Programs relate to civic, economic, or academic development
*   Teens see immediate value in activities
*   Activities result in items or performances teens can use to demonstrate their achievements to teachers or future employers…
*   … and library staff or mentors help teens understand the connections between their specific activities and broader marketable skills
