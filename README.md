**[NOT FOR GITBOOK]**

**TASKS**

*   We should cite and link to Salen, Pinkard, &amp; Peppler’s “Connected Learning Design Framework” chapter when it is published.
*   I would like Mega and Katie’s input on the language in [Section 1: Interests](export/1_introduction/what_does_connected_learning_connect.md#interests).
*   I need a case study of sponsorship in [section 2](export/2_connected_learning_design_principles/sponsorship.md).
*   I need a fourth example of sponsorship for [activity 2A](export/2_connected_learning_design_principles/section_2_activities.md#2a-self-assessment).

**ADDITIONAL MEDIA IDEAS**

Under “Why ConnectedLib?” (Section 1.2)

*   IMAGE: overview of ConnectedLib modules with Introduction to Connected Learning highlighted - get the original of what Christie made
*   VIDEO IDEA: Mega and Katie talking about ConnectedLib and briefly touching on each section. Maybe partners talking about it too. Could also be used as an “ad” for ConnectedLib.

Under “Why your library needs connected learning” (Section 3)

*   VIDEO IDEA: Short interview with Mimi; or with a partner librarian about a CL program they have and why it is important to their library
