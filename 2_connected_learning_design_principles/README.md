<p>After completing Section 2: Design Principles, you will be able to…</p>
<ul><li>Name and describe the connected learning design principles: production, multiple pathways, shared purpose, and sponsorship.</li><li>
Recognize implementations of each principle in youth programs</li><li>
Evaluate your own programs to see how well they connect these spheres</li></ul></div>

While the three spheres describe learning contexts, the four design principles describe elements of connected learning experiences. Connected learning experiences are designed to involve:
