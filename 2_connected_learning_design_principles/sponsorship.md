## Sponsorship {#sponsorship}

Connected learning programs foster sponsorship of learners’ interests. Adults, and more experienced peers can show teens that their goals are valid and important through mentoring, “brokering” (connecting individuals to other resources and opportunities), or providing tools and resources for teens, like space to work or a particular technology.

### What does sponsorship of learning look like?

*   Mentors (adults or experienced peers) are found for teens based on their common interests
*   Adults “broker” connections to other people and resources that support teens’ interests
*   Adults help teens gain access to the tools and spaces they need at the library or elsewhere
