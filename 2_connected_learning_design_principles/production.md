## Production {#production}

Hands-on, creative activities are not just powerful learning experiences. Building, performing, writing, and other creative outlets empower teens to express themselves and give teens something tangible they can take away from the experience. Remixing and curating content is also a form of production that many teens are embracing.

<p>Watch this video about Johnson County Library’s Elementia magazine, full of teen-created art, stories, poems, and songs. Then <a href="https://www.jocolibrary.org/teens/elementia">flip through a few issues</a>. Are there activities that teens do in your library that could be displayed publicly (in a magazine like this, on YouTube, in display cases, etc.)?</p>
