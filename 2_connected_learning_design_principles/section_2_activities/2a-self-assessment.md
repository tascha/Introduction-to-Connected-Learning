### 2A. Self-Assessment 

Think about your library’s youth services and programs. How well do they incorporate the spheres of teen learning and design principles of connected learning? 

For each example of connected learning on the following pages, rate your current youth services and programs as 😃  (very well) , 😐  (OK), or 😱  (not very well). Then, give each principle points based on the ratings:  😱 = 0 points, 😐  = 1 points, 😃 = 2 points, and enter the tally in the summary box.
