## Shared Purpose {#shared-purpose}

Teens are often sorted based on their ages and where they live, but the resulting groups arenâ€™t necessarily the most supportive for their individual skills and interests. Connected learning activities connect teens with each other and with adults by giving them a shared purpose around a common goal or interest, not around an age or school district. Adults and more skilled teens can share knowledge and model behavior with less advanced teens, and interest-driven programs, competitions, and challenges can bring together teens from different backgrounds who might not meet otherwise.
